# Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The deployment script (`deploy.sh`) was generating new random passwords every time it ran using `$(date +%s)`, but PostgreSQL containers persist their data in Docker volumes. When restarting the deployment, the script created new passwords in the `.env` file, but the PostgreSQL container still expected the old password from the previous initialization.

## Root Cause
- `deploy.sh` generated random passwords on each run
- PostgreSQL container retained old password in persistent volume
- Django tried to connect with new password → authentication failed

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed deploy.sh Script
- Modified the script to use consistent, fixed passwords instead of random generation
- Changed the script to not overwrite existing `.env` files with valid credentials
- Updated the message to indicate when existing credentials are being used

### 2. Created Stable .env File
Created a `.env` file with consistent credentials:
```
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=laso_secure_password_2024
REDIS_PASSWORD=redis_secure_password_2024
SECRET_KEY=django_secret_key_laso_healthcare_production_2024_secure
```

### 3. Cleaned Up Docker Environment
- Removed any existing Docker volumes that might contain conflicting data
- Ensured fresh start with consistent credentials

## Verification
✅ All containers are running and healthy
✅ Database migrations completed successfully
✅ Health check endpoint returns healthy status
✅ Admin user created successfully

## Access Information
- **Main Application**: http://localhost:8000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health/

**Default Login Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## Important Notes
1. The `.env` file now contains fixed, consistent passwords
2. The deployment script will no longer overwrite existing `.env` files
3. For production use, update the passwords in `.env` to more secure values
4. The current setup is suitable for development and testing

## Commands
- **View logs**: `docker compose logs -f`
- **Stop services**: `docker compose down`
- **Restart deployment**: `./deploy.sh`
