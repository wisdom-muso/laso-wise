# SOAP Notes and EHR System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the SOAP Notes and Electronic Health Records (EHR) system for the Laso Digital Health platform. The system provides comprehensive medical documentation capabilities with proper security, audit logging, and role-based access control.

## Features Implemented

### 1. SOAP Notes System
- **SOAP Structure**: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan components
- **Role-based Access**: Doctors can create/edit, patients can view their own notes
- **Draft Support**: Save notes as drafts for later completion
- **Appointment Integration**: SOAP notes are linked to specific appointments
- **Search & Filtering**: Find notes by patient, doctor, date, or content
- **Audit Logging**: All changes are tracked with user, timestamp, and IP

### 2. Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- **Comprehensive Medical Data**: Allergies, medications, medical history, immunizations
- **Lab Results**: Structured storage of laboratory test results
- **Imaging Results**: Radiology and imaging study results
- **Vital Signs History**: Track patient vital signs over time
- **Emergency Contacts**: Patient emergency contact information
- **Insurance Information**: Patient insurance details
- **SOAP Notes Integration**: Link to patient's SOAP notes

### 3. Security & Compliance
- **Role-based Permissions**: Different access levels for doctors, patients, and admins
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all data changes
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and business rule enforcement
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Secure handling of sensitive medical data

## Backend Implementation

### Models

    patient = models.ForeignKey(User, limit_choices_to={"role": "patient"})
    appointment = models.ForeignKey(Booking)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, limit_choices_to={"role": "doctor"})
    
    # SOAP Components
    subjective = models.TextField()
    objective = models.TextField()
    assessment = models.TextField()
    plan = models.TextField()
    
    # Metadata
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    is_draft = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

#### EHRRecord Model
```python
class EHRRecord(models.Model):
    patient = models.OneToOneField(User, limit_choices_to={"role": "patient"})
    
    # Medical Information
    allergies = models.TextField(blank=True)
    medications = models.TextField(blank=True)

    # Metadata
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    last_updated_by = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, blank=True)
```

#### AuditLog Model
```python
class AuditLog(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True)
    action = models.CharField(choices=[('create', 'Create'), ('update', 'Update'), ('delete', 'Delete'), ('view', 'View')])
    model_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    object_id = models.IntegerField()
    object_repr = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    changes = models.JSONField(default=dict)
    ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField(null=True, blank=True)
    user_agent = models.TextField(blank=True)
