## Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Permissions

1. **Patients**
   - View their own vital signs
   - Access their own dashboard
   - Receive real-time updates for their data

2. **Doctors**
   - Record vitals for their patients
   - View vitals for patients they treat
   - Receive alerts for their patients
   - Edit vitals they recorded

3. **Admins/Super Admins**
   - Full access to all patient vitals
   - System-wide oversight
   - Bulk operations
   - Alert management

### Data Validation
- Blood pressure relationship validation (systolic > diastolic)
- Cholesterol values consistency checks
- Range validation for all vital signs
- Required field enforcement

## Risk Assessment Algorithm

### Blood Pressure Categories
- **Normal**: <120/80 mmHg
- **Elevated**: 120-129/<80 mmHg
- **Stage 1**: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- **Stage 2**: ≥140/≥90 mmHg
- **Crisis**: >180/>120 mmHg

### Alert Triggers
- **Critical BP**: Systolic >180 or Diastolic >120
- **High BP**: Stage 2 hypertension
- **Heart Rate**: <50 or >120 bpm
- **Temperature**: >38.5°C
- **Oxygen Saturation**: <90%

### Risk Scoring
The system calculates cardiovascular risk based on:
- Blood pressure levels
- Heart rate variability
- BMI classification
- Age and gender factors
- Laboratory values (when available)

## Real-time Features

### WebSocket Implementation
- Automatic connection based on user role
- Room-based message routing
- Real-time vital signs updates
- Instant alert notifications
- Connection state management

### Signal-Driven Updates
- Django signals trigger real-time updates
- Automatic alert generation
- Cross-user notification system
- Data consistency maintenance

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Django 5.1.7+
