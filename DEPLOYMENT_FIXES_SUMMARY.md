# Deployment Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Multiple PostgreSQL Versions
**Problem**: The docker-compose.yml had both PostgreSQL 15 (db-backup service) and PostgreSQL 17 (main db service), which could cause confusion.

**Solution**: Updated the db-backup service to use PostgreSQL 17-alpine to maintain consistency across all PostgreSQL containers.

### 2. Database Authentication Failure
**Problem**: Django application couldn't connect to PostgreSQL due to password authentication failure. The error showed connection attempts to "10.0.2.2" which indicated network configuration issues.

**Root Cause**: Missing or incorrect .env file configuration.

**Solution**: 
- Created a proper `.env` file with correct PostgreSQL credentials
- Set `USE_SQLITE=False` to ensure PostgreSQL is used instead of SQLite
- Configured proper `DATABASE_URL` with matching credentials

### 3. Docker Compose Version Warning
**Problem**: The docker-compose.yml file had an obsolete `version: '3.8'` attribute that caused warnings.

**Solution**: Removed the obsolete version attribute from docker-compose.yml.

### 4. Environment Variables Not Set
**Problem**: Multiple environment variables were not set, causing warnings during deployment.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive .env file with all required variables:
- Database credentials (POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD)
- Django settings (SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS)
- Redis configuration
- Email settings
- Feature flags

### 5. Celery Beat Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: The Celery Beat service was experiencing database connection failures and missing table errors during startup.

**Root Cause**: Timing issue where Celery Beat started before database migrations were fully complete.

**Solution**: 
- Restarted the Celery Beat service after migrations were completed
- The service now connects properly to the database and can access the required django_celery_beat tables

## Current Status

✅ **All containers are running successfully**:
- laso_postgres (PostgreSQL 17) - Healthy
- laso_redis (Redis 7) - Healthy  
- laso_web (Django application) - Healthy
- laso_celery (Background tasks) - Healthy
- laso_celery_beat (Scheduled tasks) - Healthy
- laso_nginx (Reverse proxy) - Running
- laso_db_backup (Database backup) - Running

✅ **Database migrations completed successfully**
✅ **Admin user created** (username: admin, password: admin123)
✅ **Static files collected**
✅ **Health check passing**

## Access Information

- **Main Application**: http://localhost:8000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health/

## Default Credentials

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123

## Key Configuration Files

1. **`.env`** - Environment variables for production deployment
2. **`docker-compose.yml`** - Updated to use PostgreSQL 17 consistently
3. **Database**: Now properly configured to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite

## Next Steps

1. **Security**: Update the default admin password in production
2. **Environment**: Review and update .env file with production-specific values
3. **SSL**: Configure SSL certificates for HTTPS in production
4. **Monitoring**: Set up proper logging and monitoring for production use

The deployment is now working correctly with all services healthy and the database properly connected.
